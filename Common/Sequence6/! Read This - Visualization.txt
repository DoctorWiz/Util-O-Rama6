! Read This about Visualations:

Most of the Util-O-Rama programs do NOT use the Visualizer classes, but parts
of the Sequence classes refer to it.

So for Util-O-Rama programs (most of them) that don't need Visualizer, include
the Viz4Stub.cs class in the project along with all the Sequencer classes,
but do NOT Visualization4, VisChannel, VizGroup, or VizDrawObject.

For Util-O-Rama programs which DO use Visualizer include all 4 of the
Visualizer classes (Visualizer4, VizChannel, VizGroup, and VizDrawObject)
and NOT Viz4Stub.cs.

As of 5/16/22, I think the only Util-O-Rama programs that use Visualizer are
Channel-O-Rama, Compare-O-Rama, and InfO-Rama.
