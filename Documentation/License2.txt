The Util-O-Rama Suite is also DONATIONWARE.  You may use Util-O-Rama
completely free of charge and no donations of any type are required.
There is no difference in functionality between the freeware and donationware
versions and all features are included.
However-- If you choose, you may make a donation of at least $25.00 USD to the
animal-related charity of your choice (including but not limited to ASPCA,
Humane Society, your local animal shelter, Save-the-Whales, The Audubon
Society, World Wildlife Fund, etc. you get the idea) and send a copy of the
receipt to wizard@wizlights.com to get VIP status.
If you are a VIP user, I will prioritize bug reports and feature requests for
you.  I will not ignore serious bug reports or feature requests from non-VIP
users, they just won't get done as quickly.
