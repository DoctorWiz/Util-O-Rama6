Can't remember if webserver starts from 'default' or 'index' so they are identical
copies (which is supposedly good practice, anyway) so edit either one and then copy
it to the other.
Biggest issue is that countdown timer is not showing (black on black) but the
whole page could use a professional tune-up / beautification.
Main part of the page is just a giant SVG graphic.  Works good cuz it's all vector
and scales beautifully.  Need inkscape or other vector graphic program to edit it.
Don't worry about the util-o-rama folders/pages.  But the localshows.html file could
also use your magic touch.  Was thinking of putting all the info into tables.
