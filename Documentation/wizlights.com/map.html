In the Tanglewood Subdivision, on the Left off of Blanding Blvd. in South Orange Park, 6.2 Miles from Interstate I-295, (almost to Middleburg) Just past Gordon Chevrolet.
Also easily accessable from College Drive, Knight Boxx Road, or Old Jennings Road.  (And actually, the show looks a little better when approached from that direction.)
